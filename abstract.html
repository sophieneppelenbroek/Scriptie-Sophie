<p>Research question:
<b>How is the perception of the human figure influenced as it is depicted in a certain relation to space?</b></p>
Abstract:
Every period in history has its own specific way of representing human figures. In the Middle Ages important people were depicted taller than others. In the Renaissance Da Vinci further developed theories about the perfect proportions. Pop Art also uses resizing of human figures. Nowadays we manipulate images f human figures in selfies and by using filters and Photoshop.<br><br>
The space in which something is displayed influences the perception of figures. Perspective, large and small objects, light and dark are methods to manipulate the observation. Three-dimensional art shows a real space; the dimensions are determined by the contrast between the work itself and the surrounding area. Two-dimensional art offers an illusion of space; the frame is defined by the list.
<br><Br>Especially interesting for me is the effect to the human figure being observed.
When a human figure is displayed large or tall, or is choosing a certain attitude,
position and shape of the body, what is the impact of these actions on the
perception by the viewer? In company of others I often ‘adapt’ myself by standing
with a bent hip or by hanging on a barstool. Everything in order not to seem so long
...<br><br>
Therefore, several factors play a role in the perception of the human figure: the method of imaging, type and design of the space, the posture of the human figure and the relationship between the figure, the other objects and space.
